\description{
This set of functions classifies sanitation facilities according to various criteria. It includes functions to categorize sanitation facility types, sharing status, number of individuals sharing, and JMP (Joint Monitoring Programme) classification.

This function recodes the sharing status of sanitation facilities based on user responses. It categorizes whether the facility is shared or not shared and handles cases where the facility was skipped.

This function calculates the number of households sharing a sanitation facility and categorizes them based on predefined thresholds. It also handles the household size and survey weights in calculations.

This function combines the previous two functions to recode the sanitation facility into a JMP classification. It also includes information about whether the facility is shared or not shared.
