\value{
A data frame with additional columns:
\itemize{
\item cm_expenditure_frequent_total: The total frequent expenditure amount.
\item cm_expenditure_frequent_food_prop: Proportion of food expenditure.
\item cm_expenditure_frequent_rent_prop: Proportion of rent expenditure.
\item cm_expenditure_frequent_water_prop: Proportion of water expenditure.
\item cm_expenditure_frequent_nfi_prop: Proportion of non-food items expenditure.
\item cm_expenditure_frequent_utilities_prop: Proportion of utilities expenditure.
\item cm_expenditure_frequent_fuel_prop: Proportion of fuel expenditure.
\item cm_expenditure_frequent_transportation_prop: Proportion of transportation expenditure.
\item cm_expenditure_frequent_communication_prop: Proportion of communication expenditure.
\item cm_expenditure_frequent_other_prop: Proportion of other frequent expenditures.

\description{
This function calculates the proportion of each frequent expenditure type
relative to the total frequent expenditure. It adds new columns to the input
data frame representing these proportions.
