\description{
This function prepares dummy variables for each WG-SS component (vision, hearing, mobility, cognition, self-care, communication) and their levels (no difficulty, some difficulty, a lot of difficulty, cannot do at all). It combines them into sum scores for each level and creates disability binary cut-offs variables.
